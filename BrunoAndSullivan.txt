 Poems  in Burno and Sullivan  
 By Lewis Carroll

 He  thought he saw an albatross 
 That fluttered round the lamp
 He looked again and saw it was
 A penny-postage stamp
 "you best be getting home," he said,
 "The nights are very damp"

 He thought he saw a coach-and=four
 that stood beside the bed
 He looked again and saw it was
 A bear without a head
 "poo thing," he said
 "it's waiting to be feed"
