Do not go gentle into that good night
Dylan Thomas, 1914 - 1953

Go gently into that good night, I say
Old age should calmly drift into the end of day;
Quell rage from the fear of the failing light.

When wise men at their end know dark is right,
They see their deeds had changed a life for better
Now rest in gentle peace as that good night comes.

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

And you, my father, there on the sad height,
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

-- Dylan Thomas (1947)
