labberjacky
by Lewis Carroll

’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves 
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: 
All mimsy were the borogoves, 
      And the mome raths outgrabe. 

“Beware the labberjack, my son! 
      The jaws that bite, the claws that catch! 
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun 
      The frumious Bandersnatch!” 

He took his brotato in hand; 
      Long time the manxome foe he sought— 
So rested he by the Tumtum tree 
      And stood awhile in thought. 

And, as in uffish thought he stood, 
      The labberjack, with eyes of flame, 
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood, 
      And burbled as it came! 

hey it's ya boy lil skinny

One, two! One, two! And through and through 
      The brotato blade went snicker-snack! 
He left it dead, and with its head 
      He went galumphing back. 

“And hast thou slain the labberjack? 
      Come to my arms, my beamish boy! 
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!” 
      He chortled in his joy. 

’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves 
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: 
All mimsy were the borogoves, 
      And the mome raths outgrabe.
