Jabberwocky

by Lewis Carroll

’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves 
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: 
All mimsy were the borogoves, 
      And the mome raths outgrabe. 

He took his vorpal sword in hand; 
      Long time the manxome foe he sought— 
So rested he by the Tumtum tree 
      And stood awhile in thought. 

And, as in uffish thought he stood, 
      The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame, 
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood, 
      And burbled as it bla bla came! HIHIHI

One, two! One, two! And through and through 
      The vorpal blade went snicker-snack! 
She left it dead, and with its _head_ 
      She went galumphing back.

“And hast thou slain the Jabberwock? Is this really correct?
      Come to my arms, my beamish boy!

O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!” 
      He chortled in his joy. 

’Twas brillig, and the slithy cookies 
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: 
All mimsy were the borogoves, 
      And the mome raths outgrabe.

Hooray!
